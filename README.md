# Mood-Aware Study Environment Generator

**Project goal:** Help increase a student’s motivation to study by crafting an environment personalized for them based on their mood (animated background, recommended playlist category, and pomodoro timer)

## Short description
This web app allows users to pick their current mood (e.g., Stressed, Sleepy, Motivated) and immediately presents a themed study environment with:
- An animated background,
- A recommended playlist category (e.g. "Lofi Focus", "Classical music"),
- A suggested timer format (e.g. 25/5 Promodoro, 10/2 micro-sessions),
- A start/pause/reset timer UI and a small session history saved locally.

This repo contains the initial project structure and documentation for the CS50 final project submission.
